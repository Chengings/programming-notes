### Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
        FROM weather, cities
        WHERE city = name;

SELECT * FROM myview;
```

Views are a special version of tables in SQL. They provide a virtual table environment for various complex operations. You can select data from multiple tables, or you can select specific data based on certain criteria in views https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/views-in-sql

Views are read-only in SQLite

 * "SQL.js" allows you to create a relational database and query it entirely in the browser https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js
 * "Litestream" is a standalone streaming replication tool for SQLite. It runs as a background process and safely replicates changes incrementally to another file or S3. https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream

 * Avoid putting SQLite database files **on NFS** if multiple processes might try to access the file at the same time. https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q5
