### Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT name, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
        FROM weather, cities
        WHERE city = name;

SELECT * FROM myview;
```

Views are a special version of tables in SQL. They provide a virtual table environment for various complex operations. You can select data from multiple tables, or you can select specific data based on certain criteria in views https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/views-in-sql

Views are read-only in SQLite

## SQLite

SQLite doesn't suitable for these use cases
* Remote data
* Big data
* Concurrent writers
* Gazillion transactions/second

 * "SQL.js" allows you to create a relational database and query it entirely in the browser https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js
 * "Litestream" is a standalone streaming replication tool for SQLite. It runs as a background process and safely replicates changes incrementally to another file or S3. https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream

 * Avoid putting SQLite database files **on NFS** if multiple processes might try to access the file at the same time. https://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q5

**Duplicate Table**

Use `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE` and `INSERT ... SELECT`.
```sql
-- create an EMPTY table BASED on the DEFINITION of another table, including any column ATTRIBUTES and INDEXES defined
CREATE TABLE new_tbl LIKE orig_tbl

INSERT INTO new_tbl SELECT * FROM orig_tbl
```

There is a one liner `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` statement. Unlike above, this "create table select" statement doesn't preserve/create attributes and indexes.

[CREATE TABLE ... LIKE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-like.html) and [CREATE TABLE ... SELECT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-select.html)
