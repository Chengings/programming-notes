[Why is printf better than echo?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/65819)

Be careful about shebang (#!/usr/bin/env bash) https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/496960
> If the shebang is #!/bin/bash and you start the script as __./script the script will be executed by bash__. Absolutely no problem here.

> However, if you execute zsh ./script or __source it . ./script to the running zsh instance, it is quite common that the syntax of bash and zsh won't match.__

## Basic

`apropos` to search the "name" sections of all manual pages. Usually a wrapper for the `man -k`.
```sh
apropos copy
```

`type` to display the kind of a command
```sh
type tldr
# tldr is /usr/local/bin/tldr
type brew-update
# brew-update is an alias for brew update; brew outdated
type rs-shell
#¬†rs-shell is an alias for exec /bin/zsh -l
```

Standard input (FD 0), standard output (FD 1) and standard error (FD 2)

```sh
ls existing.txt no.file >export_ls.txt
ls existing.txt no.file 1>export_ls.txt
#¬†Redirect FD 1 to the file "export_ls.txt". Error messages are _emitted_ on FD 2.
```

```sh
ls existing.txt no.file >export_ls.txt 2>/dev/null`
# Redirect FD 1 to the file "export_ls.txt" and FD 2 to the file "/dev/null/"
```

```sh
# Redirecting standard output and standard error
ls existing.txt no.file >export_ls.txt 2>&1
ls existing.txt no.file &>export_ls.txt
# Make FD 1 target "export_ls.txt" and FD 2 target FD 1's target
```

`read line <file.txt`
Read from 'file.txt'

```sh
# Appending file redirection
echo Hello >~/world
echo World >>~/world
# Make FD x append to the end of file.
```

heredoc `<<` uses to feed data to a program without storing it in an external file and must followed by any identifier. For example, mine is 'ichiwa'
```sh
cat <<ichiwa
I love you so much.
I know I am naive.
ichiwa
```

herestring `<<<` has same function as heredoc but without delimeter. Mostly use for one line command. Might not be in every shell but available in bash, ksh,
or zsh.
```sh
cat <<<'ha ha ha I know' # Equivalent to "echo 'ha ha ha I know' | cat"

cat <<<'I love you so much.
I know I am naive.'
```

Run a job in the background
```sh
<command> &

<command>
# command is running
Ctrl-Z
```

Show status of all jobs

`jobs`

Bring a specific job to foreground

`fg <job_id>`

Resume a specific job  and run it in the background

`bg <job_id>`

Dot (.) is:
* Current directory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Unix_style
* Execute commands in the current environment (Equivalent to `source`) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_(command) && another good explanation  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/114306
* Hidden file and directory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments

## Network

`ifconfig` display the link and address status of network interfaces
```sh
ifconfig  # list all information on all network devices
ifconfig en0 up # bring en0 (Ethernet) up
ifconfig en1 down # down en1 (Wi-fi)
```

`dig (domain information groper)` check dns record
```sh
dig wikipedia.org
dig +short wikipedia.org # look up the ip
dig @1.0.0.1 # check DNS records of "wikipedia.org" by "1.0.0.1"
```

`traceroute` print the route packets take to network host
```sh
traceroute wikipedia.org
traceroute -q 10 wikipedia.org # set the number of probes to 10 probes
```

## Brace Expansion

Brace expansion generates a set of alternative combinations. Generated results need not exist as files.


```sh
echo {I,want,my,money,back}
I want my money back

echo _{I,want,my,money,back}-
_I- _want- _my- _money- _back-

echo {5..12}
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

echo {01..10}
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10

echo {c..k}
c d e f g h i j k

echo {A..C}{0..13}
A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 A11 A12 A13 B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10 C11 C12 C13


# Bash 4
echo {0001..5}
0001 0002 0003 0004 0005

echo {1..10..2}
1 3 5 7 9

echo {10..1..2}
10 8 6 4 2
```

### Example
```sh
#¬†Bulk download
wget http://docs.example.com/documentation/slides_part{1..6}.html

mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}

# Rename file
mv myText.{txt,tex}

# Create new backup file /some/file.txt.bak
cp /some/file.txt{,.bak}

# Repeating arguments
somecommand --{force,delete}

for i in {1..100}
do
   #do something 100 times
done
```

## Filenames and Pathnames in Shell: How to do it Correctly (   https://dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html)

```sh
# Basic rules

## Double-quote parameter (variable) references and command substitutions
"$file"
"$(pwd)"
"$(dirname "$file")"

## Prefix all globs so they cannot expand to begin with ‚Äú-‚Äù
cat ./*                   # Use this, NOT "cat *" ... Must have 1+ files.
for file in ./* ; do      # Use this, NOT "for file in *" (beware empty lists)
...
done
```
