### Latency numbers every programmer should know
    L1 cache reference ......................... 0.5 ns
    Branch mispredict ............................ 5 ns
    L2 cache reference ........................... 7 ns
    Mutex lock/unlock ........................... 25 ns
    Main memory reference ...................... 100 ns             
    Compress 1K bytes with Zippy ............. 3,000 ns  =   3 µs
    Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network ....... 20,000 ns  =  20 µs
    SSD random read ........................ 150,000 ns  = 150 µs
    Read 1 MB sequentially from memory ..... 250,000 ns  = 250 µs
    Round trip within same datacenter ...... 500,000 ns  = 0.5 ms
    Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD* ..... 1,000,000 ns  =   1 ms
    Disk seek ........................... 10,000,000 ns  =  10 ms
    Read 1 MB sequentially from disk .... 20,000,000 ns  =  20 ms
    Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA .... 150,000,000 ns  = 150 ms

Assuming ~1GB/sec SSD
