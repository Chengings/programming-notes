### [Docker for Mac] Caching options for bind-mounted volume
* Consistent: Host and container have an identical view of the mount at all times.
* Cached: Permit delays before updates on the host appear in the container.
* Delegated: Permit delays before updates on the container appear in the host.

   - '~/jenkins/:/var/jenkins_home:delegated'
   - '~/environment_keys:/var/data:cached'
```
